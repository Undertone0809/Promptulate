    "2. **Calculator Tool:** this tool would be responsible for solving a user’s math queries. This includes anything involving numerical calculations. For example, if a user asks what the square root of 4 is, this tool would be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reasoning Tool:** the final tool in our application setup would be a reasoning tool, responsible for tackling logical/reasoning-based user queries. Any mathematical word problems should also be handled with this tool.\n",

    "## Understanding promptulate Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Promptulate agents are designed to enhance interaction with language models by providing an interface for more complex and interactive tasks. We can think of an agent as an intermediary between users and a large language model. Agents seek to break down a seemingly complex user query, that our LLM might not be able to tackle on its own, into easier, actionable steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our application flow, we defined a few different tools that we would like to use for our math application. Based on the user input, the agent should decide which of these tools to use. If a tool is not required, it should not be used. Promptulate agents can simplify this for us. These agents use a language model to choose a sequence of actions to take. Essentially, the LLM acts as the “brain” of the agent, guiding it on which tool to use for a particular query, and in which order. This is different from Proptulate chains where the sequence of actions are hardcoded in code. Promptulate offers a wide set of tools that can be integrated with an agent. These tools include, and are not limited to, online search tools, API-based tools, chain-based tools etc. For more information on Promptulate agents and their types, see [this](https://undertone0809.github.io/promptulate/#/modules/agent?id=agent)."
