# mem0
Mem0 (pronounced “mem-zero”) enhances AI assistants and agents with an intelligent memory layer, enabling personalized AI interactions. 
Mem0 remembers user preferences, adapts to individual needs, and continuously improves over time, making it ideal for customer support chatbots, AI assistants, and autonomous systems.
